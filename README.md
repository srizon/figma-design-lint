## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Open your Figma file** that you want to analyze

2. **Launch the plugin** from the Plugins menu

3. **Choose your scan scope**:
   - **Scan Selection**: Select specific frames/components first, then click "Scan Selection"
   - **Scan Page**: Click "Scan Page" to analyze the current page
   - **Scan File**: Click "Scan File" to check the entire document

4. **Review the results**:
   - Check the summary cards for quick statistics
   - Use the tabs to explore different types of detached elements
   - Click on any item to select it in Figma

### Understanding the Results

#### Summary Cards
- **Text Styles**: Teal - Text without applied styles
- **Variables**: Blue - Colors that could be variables
- **Layers**: Green - Custom shapes, vectors, and other layers not in components

#### Smart Suggestions
The plugin automatically suggests fixes for detected issues:

**Text Style Suggestions**
- **Exact Match**: Font family, size, line height, and letter spacing all match
- **Partial Match**: Font family and size match, other properties may differ
- **Fuzzy Match**: Font family matches, other properties may differ

**Color Variable Suggestions**
- **Exact Match**: Color values are identical
- **Similar Match**: Colors are within 10% tolerance



#### One-Click Fixes
- **Apply Text Style**: Automatically apply the suggested text style to the text element
- **Apply Color Variable**: Replace the color with the suggested design token
- **Ignore**: Dismiss the suggestion if it's not appropriate

#### Detected Elements
Each item shows:
- **Name**: The layer/component name
- **Type**: The element type (INSTANCE, TEXT, etc.)
- **Path**: Full hierarchy path to locate the element
- **Content**: Preview of text content or color values
- **Font Properties**: For text elements, shows font family, size, line height, and letter spacing
- **Suggestions**: Recommended fixes with accept/reject buttons

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with "Scan Selection" on a few frames to understand the results
2. **Review Suggestions**: Check each suggestion before applying to ensure it's appropriate
3. **Regular Checks**: Run the plugin periodically to maintain design system health
4. **Batch Fixes**: Use the one-click fixes to quickly resolve multiple issues
5. **Team Coordination**: Share results with your team to maintain consistency

## What Gets Detected

## Smart Suggestions & Fixes

### Text Style Matching
The plugin analyzes text elements without applied styles and finds matching text styles from your design system:
- **Font Family & Style**: Matches Inter Regular, Inter Bold, etc.
- **Font Size**: Matches exact pixel sizes (16px, 24px, etc.)
- **Line Height**: Matches pixel or percentage line heights
- **Letter Spacing**: Matches tracking values

### Color Variable Matching
For colors not using design tokens, the plugin suggests existing variables:
- **Exact Color Match**: Finds variables with identical RGB values
- **Similar Color Match**: Finds variables within 10% color tolerance
- **Fill & Stroke Support**: Detects both background fills and stroke/outline colors
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Works on all shape types, text outlines, vectors, and custom graphics



### Detached Text Styles
- Text layers without applied text styles
- Text that uses local formatting instead of design system styles
- Can lead to inconsistent typography across your designs

### Detached Variables
- **Solid Color Fills**: Background colors that could be converted to design tokens
- **Solid Color Strokes**: Border/outline colors that aren't using variables
- **Text Outlines**: Stroke colors applied to text elements
- **Shape Borders**: Stroke colors on rectangles, circles, vectors, and custom shapes
- **Effect Colors**: Shadow and other effect colors that could use variables
- Helps identify opportunities for better variable usage across all color properties

### Detached Layers
- Custom vector shapes and boolean operations
- Rectangles, ellipses, polygons, and other shapes not in components
- Text elements that could be part of components
- Images and other media elements
- Groups containing components or custom shapes
- Any layer that isn't part of a component and could benefit from design system integration

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Loading
- Ensure all files (`manifest.json`, `code.js`, `ui.html`) are in the same directory
- Check that the manifest.json has the correct file references
- Restart Figma if the plugin doesn't appear

### No Results Found
- Make sure you have elements selected when using "Scan Selection"
- Verify that your file contains the types of elements you're looking for
- Try scanning a larger scope (Page or File) if selection is empty

### Performance Issues
- For large files, use "Scan Selection" instead of "Scan File"
- Close other plugins to free up memory
- Consider scanning in smaller chunks

## Development

### Project Structure
```
figma-design-lint/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json    # Plugin configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code.js         # Main plugin logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.html         # User interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # This file
```

### Customization
You can modify the detection logic in `code.js`:
- Adjust detection criteria for different element types
- Add new types of detached elements to scan for
- Modify the scanning scope and depth

### Building for Production
1. Test thoroughly with various file types
2. Update the manifest.json with your plugin details
3. Follow Figma's plugin publishing guidelines
4. Submit to the Figma Community
